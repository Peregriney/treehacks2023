# FluFinder

In the US, the price of eggs rose 60% in calendar year 2023, after an outbreak of avian influenza, more commonly known as bird flu, wiped out 50 million chickens. A previous outbreak in 2014/2015 also had death tolls of 55 million chickens, with economic damages of $3.3 billion.

The risks aren’t limited on farms— human-to-human infection of the avian flu would cause economic losses of USD $2 trillion. 

FluFinder empowers farmers to monitor bird flu and potential zoonotic outbreaks in agriculture, building a more healthy and sustainable food system. Most outbreaks start with foreign vectors: specifically, non-flock birds (e.g. ducks, geese, seagulls) that wander near the flock. FluFinder uses autonomous drone technology to move in the perimeter boundaries of where chickens roam, identifying red flags/threats from anomalous birds. This is especially critical for ethical and environmentally-friendly poultry practices that allow chickens space to roam, such as cage-free, free-range, and pasture-raised egg production. (Investigations show that several million birds have been restricted from outdoor access in order to curb the spread of bird flu from wild bird vectors.)
